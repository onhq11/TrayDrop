## About
TrayDrop is an open-source program that combines clipboard synchronization with fast peer-to-peer data transfer to improve the quaity of the pc-phone ecosystem. For peer-to-peer file transfer, the application uses the already existing [PairDrop](https://github.com/schlagmichdoch/PairDrop) service, and for the clipboard synchronization, its own [TrayDrop Server](https://github.com/onhq11/TrayDrop-Server), which is based on the MongoDB database.

## Features
- Cross-platform clipboard synchronization
- Peer-To-Peer file sharing in background - [PairDrop](https://github.com/schlagmichdoch/PairDrop)
- Option to integrate your own PairDrop server instead of public one - [pairdrop.net](pairdrop.net)
- Auto open the PairDrop window when file received
